Using R to process Australian court decisions

My current tasks are to put judgements from Australian courts into a folder and make them tidy in R.
Once I've cleared this hurdle, I can do analysis of the text.

My current problem is that different jurisdictions capture information about judgements in different ways.

My current thought is that I should ask R to determine the jurisdiction first, and adapt different rules for different courts.
